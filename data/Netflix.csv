I was always under the impression that the subscription fee should cover having to need ads in your programming. If you get revenue from consumers, no need to saturate that income with advertising revenue too, right? Corporate greed keeps this platform on sub-par level. If I'm paying for a service, ads shouldn't be in it. Broke your own app with greedy ads..",1

74ea00a1-8001-48cf-8f70-ba4d8be794f0,Why are we PAYING to watch ads? What a joke? I am now being forced off my $12.99 plan to the AD plan that I DO NOT want however I absolutely refuse to pay the rediculious premium prices. Netflix used to be good but they have just become so disgustingly GREEDY! I am so unbelievably disappointed! What was wrong with the $12.99 plan? If I wanted to watch adds I'd watch free to air. They have ads so they can provide a FREE service. Netflix is a paid service so shouldn't have ads at all. Just GREEDY!,1

Are these arrivals new content or from several decades ago? Netflix's own content is poorly rated garbage (Seven Samurai set in Space as an example). It struggles with 720p, how's it going to handle 1020p? The free to air offerings here outstrip the cheap flops you push at me. Simply not worth the price.",1

Absolutely ridiculous if you cannot use it while travelling because you don't speak english or the country language which is the case for our grandparent that mostly use Netflix.

I am certain that noone could have gotten into my account using the password. This means Netflix's privacy & security protocols are very very poor.

4b6c77e2-f2c0-46e7-af45-f2d681b7b0d5,Netflix can increase viewership by adding 2 play buttons for indian movies one to play movie another to play only songs. In addition if you let people make Playlists out of the songs and let them be shared it will give a good bump in number of minutes Indian subscribers spend on Netflix.,5

But Netflix also has its limits,like for example,you won't encounter sports,or most of the Disney shows. Still though there is just a lot of shows on such a tiny app from all over the world. Maybe some sports added there will great too. Maybe.",5

3adfd2a1-4e7a-4de0-98f9-5cf2cf6ee584,Netflix used to be good. It's horrible now. Me and my boyfriend travel a lot and sometimes he travels alone or I travel alone to another country . But for some reason Netflix won't let us both on it even when we are paying the price for 2people. It's ridiculous now all they care about is the money. They have told us to buy a separate account which we will not be doing. We have enough bills to pay for and they expect us to pay another 15-20 euro for anothe just so both of us can use the account.,1

bfab0b8c-ea41-47c5-83eb-b8acc0954f58,Netflix is Garbage you are better off downloading one of those free apps and watching newer movies and shows. I am the main account and I have to ask permission every time I use my netflix on my phone. Ridiculous new policies. I can't even share with who I choose to share with. My account that I pay for every month. Netflix is going straight to the garbage they can't compete with these newer better movie free apps,1

b6f5b717-44e2-4a2b-b007-2ded38ff6d9b,world worst app is netflix because even if I charged it I can't watch it . It doesn't support autopayment in SBI bank . When I type my email the app will say that cannot support and when I type my password same thing happens. This app is good for nothing . Charging netflix is waste of time The main issue is even I charged it I can't even see a movie 😕.,1

I recommend not to get wifi when you are getting Netflix cause when you get rid of wifi there's an update that makes Netflix dark screen. I had to cancel it cause I couldn't watch Monday night raw I could just hear it. Google ruins this app if you have wifi and then have to get rid of wifi. It will no longer let you watch Netflix on your phones all cause of nosey Google and stupid wifi. Otherwise i would give them five stars cause can cancel easily,3

My one star is because the netflix player in chrome is very frustrating, I'm using a touchscreen Lenovo PC. The play/pause & navigation buttons keep getting stuck when I press them, causing the controller to stay on the screen while you're trying to enjoy a show. Please pass this to the relevant team so they can fix this annoying touchscreen bug. Thanks guys! 🙏🙏",1

On December 26th I had paid a 199/- plan and now I was facing an issue that which showing me to pay 499/- to continue but actually I have 15 more days. This is happening all the time I was paying to the Netflix. I had no idea why this happened the same everytime. And now I had lost almost a 2 month cost of 399/- on paying Netflix of 199/- (two times). I need a quick solution for this. And I need my membership of 199/- (basic) back.,1

01812e62-ed91-4af3-a397-68d87dc9b8b5,A once great app that Netflix long ago ceased to care about. Quality & volume of content has been in decline for years. The app itself gets worse every year or so and the descriptions of the shows betray how little Netflix cares as the description of many don't even tell you what the movie is about anymore simply saying movie stars X actor or Y person said it was good. If even Netflix doesn't care enough about their content to tell you what it is then that's a pretty damning indictment.,1

The description of many of them don't even tell you what the movie is about anymore simply saying movie stars X actor or Y person said it was good. It appears Netflix themselves neither know nor care what's on their own platform. And given the state of the app it's equally obvious they don't care about it either.,2
